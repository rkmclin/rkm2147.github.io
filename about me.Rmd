# Who am I?
Still figuring that part out to be quite honest, but hey, I like the direction I'm headed. Below are some fun facts about me! Check them out

I am left handed! When I was younger I would switch between left and right, until I settled on the left once and for all. 

# Fact 2

I was born in Chicago, IL. But during my childhood lived in Ohio, Louisiana, and Tennessee.

# Fact 3

I have a West Highland White Terrier named Stormie. He's going to be 15 this year, such an adult!
