# Hi! 
Hi there. My name is Rona√© McLin. I am currently a student at Columbia's Mailman School of Public health in the City of New York. This website contains my academic and professional experience.  Normally I would make things more extensive, but this is for a p8105 homework assignment :)

This website is to fulfill a p8105 homework assignment, more specifically homework #4 regarding interactivity. On the other pages of this website you find my resume, some of my favorites sources of media, a flexdashboard containing some cool plots, and more!
