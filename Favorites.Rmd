One of my favorite past times is checking out the recommendations of those I trust! Books, restaurants, snacks, you name it! So think of this page as my way of doing that for you. You'll find below some things I think are cool

# Stella Parks

During quarantine, like many others, I found myself baking a ton! I became obsessed with Stella Parks' recipes, and rightly so. She has an amazing book that tackles American treats and desserts, but in a way that a home cook can easily manage.  Below you can find a link to her website.

# Alison Roman

Alison Roman is another source of great recipes. Her laid back personality eas initially infectious but quickly soured when she found herself into some hot water. Nonetheless her 2 most recent books offer great finds.
